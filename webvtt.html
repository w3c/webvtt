  <section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>The <dfn>WebVTT</dfn> (Web Video Text Tracks) format is
  intended for marking up external text track resources.</p>

  <p>The main use for WebVTT files is captioning video content. Here
  is a sample file that captions an interview:</p>

  <pre>WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We are in New York City

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We're actually at the Lucern Hotel, just down the street

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>from the American Museum of Natural History

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And with me is Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Astrophysicist, Director of the Hayden Planetarium

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>at the AMNH.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Thank you for walking down here.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And I want to do a follow-up on the last conversation we did.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.500 align:end size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>When we e-mailed&mdash;

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500 align:start size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>Didn't we talk about enough in that conversation?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.500 align:end size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>No! No no no no; 'cos 'cos obviously 'cos

00:32.500 --> 00:33.500 align:start size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>&lt;i>Laughs&lt;/i>

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>You know I'm so excited my glasses are falling off here.</pre>


  <section>
  <h3>Cues with multiple lines</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Line breaks in cues are honored. User agents will also insert extra line breaks if necessary to
  fit the cue in the cue's width. In general, therefore, authors are encouraged to write cues all on
  one line except when a line break is definitely necessary, and to not manually line-wrap for
  aesthetic reasons alone.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>These captions on a public service announcement video demonstrate line breaking:</p>

   <pre>WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
Never drink liquid nitrogen.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
&mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
&mdash; You could die.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
The Organisation for Sample Public Service Announcements accepts no liability for the content of this advertisement, or for the consequences of any actions taken on the basis of the information provided.</pre>

   <p>The first cue is simple, it will probably just display on one line. The second will take two
   lines, one for each speaker. The third will wrap to fit the width of the video, possibly taking
   multiple lines. For example, the three cues could look like this:</p>

<!-- 50 -->
   <pre>           Never drink liquid nitrogen.

        &mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
                &mdash; You could die.

    The Organisation for Sample Public Service
    Announcements accepts no liability for the
    content of this advertisement, or for the
     consequences of any actions taken on the
        basis of the information provided.</pre>

   <p>If the width of the cues is smaller, the first two cues could wrap as well, as in the following
   example. Note how the second cue's explicit line break is still honored, however:</p>

<!-- 25 -->
   <pre>       Never drink
    liquid nitrogen.

  &mdash; It will perforate
      your stomach.
    &mdash; You could die.

  Sample Public Service
  Announcements accepts
  no liability for the
     content of this
  advertisement, or for
   the consequences of
  any actions taken on
    the basis of the
  information provided.</pre>

   <p>Also notice how the wrapping is done so as to keep the line lengths balanced.</p>

  </div>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3>Comments</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Comments can be included in WebVTT files.</p>

  <p>Comments are just blocks that start with the word "<code title="">NOTE</code>" (followed by a
  space or newline). A comment ends at the first blank line.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Here, a one-line comment is used to note a possible problem with a cue.</p>

   <pre>WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
Never drink liquid nitrogen.

NOTE I'm not sure the timing is right on the following cue.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
&mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
&mdash; You could die.</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, the author has written many comments.</p>

   <pre>WEBVTT

NOTE
This file was written by Jill. I hope
you enjoy reading it. Some things to
bear in mind:
- I was lip-reading, so the cues may
not be 100% accurate
- I didn't pay too close attention to
when the cues should start or end.

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
Never drink liquid nitrogen.

NOTE check next cue

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
&mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
&mdash; You could die.

NOTE end of file</pre>

  </div>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h3>Other features</h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>WebVTT also supports some less-often used features.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, one of the cues has an identifier:</p>

   <pre>WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That's an, an, that's an L!

transcription-credit
00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Transcribed by Celestials&trade;</pre>

   <p>This allows a style sheet to specifically target that cue:</p>

   <pre>::cue(#transcription-credit) { color: red }</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example, each cue says who is talking using voice spans. In the first cue, the span
   specifying the speaker is also annotated with two classes, "first" and "loud". In the third cue,
   there is also some italics text (not associated with a specific speaker). The last cue is
   annotated with just the class "loud".</p>

   <pre>WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
&lt;v.first.loud Esme>It's a blue apple tree!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
&lt;v Mary>No way!

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
&lt;v Esme>Hee!&lt;/v> &lt;i>laughter&lt;/i>

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
&lt;v.loud Mary>That's awesome!</pre>

   <p>Notice that as a special exception, the voice spans don't have to be closed if they cover the
   entire cue text.</p>

   <p>Style sheets can style these spans:</p>

   <pre>::cue(v[voice="Esme"]) { color: blue }
::cue(v[voice="Mary"]) { color: green }
::cue(i) { font-style: italic }
::cue(.loud) { font-size: 2em }</pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
  <p>This example shows two regions containing rollup captions for two different speakers. Fred's cues scroll up in a region in the left half of the video, Bill's cues scroll up in a region on the right half of the video. Fred's first cue disappears at 12.5sec  even through it is defined until 20sec because its region is limited to 3 lines and at 12.5sec a fourth cue appears:
  </p>

  <pre>WEBVTT
Region: id=fred width=50% lines=3 regionanchor=0%,100% viewportanchor=10%,90% scroll=up
Region: id=bill width=50% lines=3 regionanchor=100%,100% viewportanchor=90%,90% scroll=up

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000 region:fred align:left
&lt;v Fred>Hi, my name is Fred

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:22.500 region:bill align:right
&lt;v Bill>Hi, I'm Bill

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:25.000 region:fred align:left
&lt;v Fred>Would you like to get a coffee?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:27.500 region:bill align:right
&lt;v Bill>Sure! I've only had one today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:30.000 region:fred align:left
&lt;v Fred>This is my fourth!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:32.500 region:fred align:left
&lt;v Fred>OK, let's go.</pre>

  <p>Note that regions are only defined for horizontal cues.</p>

  <!-- Describe metadata, caption/subtitle, chapter & description cues -->

  <section>
  <h3>Text Track Cues</h3>

  <p>WebVTT cues are HTML <a title="text track cue">text track cues</a> that additionally
  consist of the following: <a href="#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a></p>

  <dl>

   <dt><dfn title="text track cue writing direction">A writing direction</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>A writing direction, either <dfn title="text track cue horizontal writing
    direction">horizontal</dfn> (a line extends horizontally and is positioned vertically, with
    consecutive lines displayed below each other), <dfn title="text track cue vertical growing left
    writing direction">vertical growing left</dfn> (a line extends vertically and is positioned
    horizontally, with consecutive lines displayed to the left of each other<!-- used for east
    asian-->), or <dfn title="text track cue vertical growing right writing direction">vertical
    growing right</dfn> (a line extends vertically and is positioned horizontally, with consecutive
    lines displayed to the right of each other<!-- used for mongolian -->).</p>

    <p>If the <a title="text track cue writing direction">writing direction</a> is <a
    title="text track cue horizontal writing direction">horizontal</a>, then <a title="text
    track cue line position">line position</a> percentages are relative to the height of the
    video, and <a title="text track cue text position">text position</a> and <a title="text
    track cue size">size</a> percentages are relative to the width of the video.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, <a title="text track cue line position">line position</a> percentages are
    relative to the width of the video, and <a title="text track cue text position">text
    position</a> and <a title="text track cue size">size</a> percentages are relative to
    the height of the video.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="text track cue snap-to-lines flag">A snap-to-lines flag</dfn>
   <dd>

    <p>A boolean indicating whether the <a title="text track cue line position">line's
    position</a> is a line position (positioned to a multiple of the line dimensions of the first
    line of the cue), or whether it is a percentage of the dimension of the video.</p>

    <p>Cues whose <a>text track cue snap-to-lines flag</a> is set will be placed within the
    title-safe area on user agents that use overscan. Cues with the flag unset will be positioned as
    requested (modulo overlap avoidance if multiple cues are in the same place).</p>

   </dd>

   <dt><dfn title="text track cue line position">A line position</dfn>
   <dd>
    <p>Either a number giving the position of the lines of the cue, to be interpreted as defined by
    the <a title="text track cue writing direction">writing direction</a> and <a
    title="text track cue snap-to-lines flag">snap-to-lines flag</a> of the cue, or the special
    value <dfn title="text track cue automatic line position">auto</dfn>, which means the position
    is to depend on the other active tracks.</p>

    <p>A <a>text track cue</a> has a <dfn>text track cue computed line position</dfn> whose
    value is that returned by the following algorithm, which is defined in terms of the other
    aspects of the cue:</p>

    <ol>

  <h4>WebVTT region definition</h4>

  <p>A <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> may contain a reference to a

  a region, a <a>WebVTT region metadata header</a> is specified.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT region metadata header</dfn> is a special kind of
  <a>WebVTT metadata header</a> where both of the following apply:</p>

    <li>The <a>WebVTT metadata header name</a> is the string "<code>Region</code>".</li>
    <li>The <a>WebVTT metadata header value</a> is a <a>WebVTT region setting list</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT region</dfn> represents its <a title="WebVTT region setting list">WebVTT region settings</a>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>WebVTT region setting list</dfn> of a <a>WebVTT region metadata header</a> consists of zero or more of the following components, in any order, separated from each other by one or more U+0020 SPACE characters or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) characters. Each component must not be included more than once per <a>WebVTT region setting list</a> string.</p>

  <ul> 
   <li>A <a>WebVTT region identifier</a>.</li> <!-- id:fred -->

   <li>A <a>WebVTT region scroll setting</a>.</li> <!-- scroll:up -->
  </ul>

  <p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region setting list</a> gives configuration
  options regarding the dimensions, positioning and anchoring of the region. For
  example, it allows a group of cues within a region to be anchored in the center of the
  region and the center of the video viewport. In this example, when the font size grows,
  the region grows uniformly in all directions from the center.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT region identifier</dfn> consists of the

   <li><p>A U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character (%).</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p class ="note">The <a>WebVTT region anchor setting</a> provides

  <p class ="note">The <a>WebVTT region scroll setting</a>
  specifies whether cues rendered into the region are allowed to move out of their initial
  rendering place and roll up, i.e. move towards the top of the video viewport. If the
  scroll setting is omitted, cues do not move from their rendered position.</p> 

  <p class="note">Cues are added to a region one line at a time below existing cue lines.
  When an existing rendered cue line is removed, and it was above another already rendered
  cue line, that cue line moves into its space, thus scrolling in the given direction. If
  there is not enough space for a new cue line to be added to a region, the top-most cue
  line is pushed off the visible region (thus slowly becoming invisible as it moves into
  overflow:hidden). This eventually makes space for the new cue line and allows it to be
  added.</p>
    
  <p class="note">When there is no scroll direction, cue lines are added in the empty line
  closest to the line in the bottom of the region. If no empty line is available, the oldest
  line is replaced.</p>

  </ul>

  <p class="note">A <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> gives configuration
  options regarding the position and alignment of the cue. For
  example, it allows a cue to be aligned to the left or positioned at
  the top right.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT cue setting</a> that
  consists of the following components, in the order given:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>The string "<code title="">vertical</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</li>
   <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
   <li>One of the following strings as the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: "<code title="">rl</code>", "<code title="">lr</code>".</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">A <a>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</a>
  configures the cue to use vertical text layout rather than
  horizontal text layout. Vertical text layout is sometimes used in

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT line position cue setting</dfn> consists of the
  following components, in the order given:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>The string "<code title="">line</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
   <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>

     </dd>
    </dl>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">A <a>WebVTT line position cue setting</a>
  configures the position of the cue. For horizontal cues, this is the
  vertical position. The position can be given either as a percentage,
  which gives the distance from the top of the frame, or as a line
  number. Line numbers are based on the size of the first line of the
  cue. Positive line numbers count from the top of the frame (the top
  line is numbered 0), negative line numbers from the bottom of the
  frame (the bottom line is numbered &#x2212;1).</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT text position cue setting</dfn> consists of the

  <p class="note">A <a>WebVTT text position cue setting</a>
  configures the position of the text in the direction orthogonal to
  the <a>WebVTT line position cue setting</a>. For horizontal
  cues, this is the horizontal position. The <a>WebVTT text
  position cue setting</a> is given as a percentage, calculated
  from the edge of the frame that the text begins (so for
  left-to-right English text, the left edge).</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT size cue setting</dfn> consists of the
  following components, in the order given:</p>

  <p class="note">A <a>WebVTT alignment cue setting</a>
  configures the alignment of the text within the cue. The keywords
  are relative to the text direction; for left-to-right English text,
  "<code title="">start</code>" means left-aligned.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT region cue setting</dfn> consists of the
  following components, in the order given:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>The string "<code>region</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>

  <h3>Properties of cue sequences</h3>
  
  <section>
  <h4>WebVTT file using only nested cues</h4>

  <p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all have an end time offset
  <var title="">x</var> greater than or equal to the end time offsets
  of all the cues whose start time offsets are less than <var
  title="">x</var> is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file using only nested
  cues</dfn>.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>The following example matches this definition:</p>

  <pre>WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 01:24.000
Introduction

00:00.000 --> 00:44.000
Topics

00:44.000 --> 01:19.000
Presenters

01:24.000 --> 05:00.000
Scrolling Effects

01:35.000 --> 03:00.000
Achim's Demo

03:00.000 --> 05:00.000
Timeline Panel</pre>

   <p>Notice how you can express the cues in this WebVTT file as a
   tree structure:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>WebVTT file
     <ul>
      <li>Introduction
       <ul>
        <li>Topics
        <li>Presenters
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Scrolling Effects
       <ul>
        <li>Achim's Demo
        <li>Timeline Panel
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>

   <p>If the file has cues that can't be expressed in this fashion,
   then they don't match the definition of a <a>WebVTT file using
   only nested cues</a>. For example:</p>

  <pre>WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 01:00.000
The First Minute

00:30.000 --> 01:30.000
The Final Minute</pre>

   <p>In this ninety-second example, the two cues partly overlap, with
   the first ending before the second ends and the second starting
   before the first ends. This therefore is not a <a>WebVTT file
   using only nested cues</a>.</p>

  </div>

  </section><!-- end cue sequence properties -->

  <section>
  <h3>Types of WebVTT files</h3>

  <p>The syntax definition of WebVTT files allows authoring of a wide
  variety of WebVTT files with a mix of cues. However, only a small
  subset of WebVTT file types are typically authored.</p>

  <p>Conformance checkers, when validating <a>WebVTT</a> files, may
  offer to restrict syntax checking for validating these types.</p>  

  <section>
  <h4>WebVTT file using metadata content</h4>

  <p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all have a <a>cue
  payload</a> that is <a>WebVTT metadata text</a> is

  <h2>WebVTT file format: Parsing</h3>

  <section>
  <h3>WebVTT file parsing</h3>

  <p>A <dfn>WebVTT parser</dfn>, given an input byte stream and a
  <a>text track list of cues</a> <var title="">output</var>,
  must decode the byte stream using the <a title="UTF-8 decode">UTF-8
  decode</a> algorithm, and then must parse the resulting string according
  to the <a>WebVTT parser algorithm</a> below. This results in 
  <a title="text track cue">text track cues</a> being added to <var
  title="">output</var>. <a href="#refsRFC3629">[RFC3629]</a></p>

  <p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a>, specifically its conversion and
  parsing steps, is typically run asynchronously, with the input byte
  stream being updated incrementally as the resource is downloaded;
  this is called an <dfn>incremental WebVTT parser</dfn>.</p>

  <p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a> verifies a file signature before
  parsing the provided byte stream. If the stream lacks this WebVTT
  file signature, then the parser aborts.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>WebVTT parser algorithm</dfn> is as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>

     <p>Let <var title="">regions</var> to be a <a>text track list of regions</a>.</p>

    <p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being parsed, after
    conversion to Unicode, and with the following transformations
    applied:</p>

    <ul>

     <li><p>Replace all U+0000 NULL characters by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT
     CHARACTERs.</p></li>

     <li><p>Replace each U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED
     (CRLF) character pair by a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
     character.</p></li>

     <li><p>Replace all remaining U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters by
     U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters.</p></li>

    </ul>

   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">input</var>, initially pointing at the start of the
   string. In an <a>incremental WebVTT parser</a>, when this
   algorithm (or further algorithms that it uses) moves the <var
   title="">position</var> pointer, the user agent must wait until
   appropriate further characters from the byte stream have been added
   to <var title="">input</var> before moving the pointer, so that the
   algorithm never reads past the end of the <var title="">input</var>
   string. Once the byte stream has ended, and all characters have
   been added to <var title="">input</var>, then the <var
   title="">position</var> pointer may, when so instructed by the
   algorithms, be moved past the end of <var
   title="">input</var>.</p></li>

   <li>Let <var title="">line</var> be a string variable. Unset the
   <var title="">already collected line</var> flag.</li>


   <!-- SIGNATURE CHECK -->

   <li><p><a>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are
   <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters. Let <var
   title="">line</var> be those characters, if any.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> is less than six characters
   long, then abort these steps. The file does not start with the
   correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not
   successfully processed.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> is exactly six characters long
   but does not exactly equal "<code title="">WEBVTT</code>", then
   abort these steps. The file does not start with the correct
   <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not
   successfully processed.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">line</var> is more than six characters long
   but the first six characters do not exactly equal "<code
   title="">WEBVTT</code>", or the seventh character is neither a
   U+0020 SPACE character nor a U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)
   character, then abort these steps. The file does not start with the
   correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not
   successfully processed.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var title="">position</var> is past the end of <var
   title="">input</var>, then abort these steps. The file was
   successfully processed, but it contains no useful data and so no
   <a title="text track cue">text track cues</a> where added to
   <var title="">output</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The character indicated by <var title="">position</var> is a
   U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character. Advance <var
   title="">position</var> to the next character in <var
   title="">input</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p><i title="">Header</i>: <a>Collect a sequence of
   characters</a> that are <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   characters. Let <var title="">line</var> be those characters, if

  <h3>Cue timings and settings parsing</h3>

  <p>When the algorithm above requires that the user agent
  <dfn>Collect WebVTT cue timings and settings</dfn> from a string
  <var title="">input</var> for a <a>text track cue</a> <var
  title="">cue</var>, the user agent must run the following
  algorithm.</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">input</var> be the string being
   parsed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">position</var> be a pointer into <var
   title="">input</var>, initially pointing at the start of the
   string.</p></li>

   <li><p><a>Skip whitespace</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p><a>Collect a WebVTT timestamp</a>. If that algorithm
   fails, then abort these steps and return failure. Otherwise, let
   <var title="">cue</var>'s <a>text track cue start time</a>
   be the collected time.</p></li>

   <li><p><a>Skip whitespace</a>.</p></li>

   <!-- we can't be beyond the end of the string until we've seen the
   arrow, since we know the arrow is in the string and nothing we've
   done so far would move us past the first "-". -->

   <li><p>If <!--<var title="">position</var> is beyond the end of
   <var title="">input</var> or if--> the character at <var

   <li><p>If <!--<var title="">position</var> is beyond the end of
   <var title="">input</var> or if--> the character at <var

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">settings</var> be the result of <a

   <li>

    <p>For each token <var title="">setting</var> in the list <var

    <ol>

     <li><p>If <var title="">setting</var> does not contain a U+003A
     COLON character (:), or if the first U+003A COLON character (:)
     in <var title="">setting</var> is either the first or last
     character of <var title="">setting</var>, then jump to the step
     labeled <i>next setting</i>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">name</var> be the leading substring of
     <var title="">setting</var> up to and excluding the first U+003A
     COLON character (:) in that string.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">value</var> be the trailing substring of

  <h3>Cues in isolation</h3>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for interpreting WebVTT cue text</dfn> (e.g. for use as chapter titles) are as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">nodes</var> be the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> obtained by
   applying the <a>WebVTT cue text parsing rules</a> to the <var title="">cue</var>'s
   <a>text track cue text</a>.</p>

  <h4>Processing model</h4>

  <p>The <dfn>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text
  tracks</dfn> render the <a title="text track">text
  tracks</a> of a <a>media element</a> (specifically, a
  <code>video</code> element), or of another playback mechanism, by
  applying the steps below. All the <a title="text track">text
  tracks</a> that use these rules for a given <a>media
  element</a>, or other playback mechanism, are rendered together,
  to avoid overlapping subtitles from multiple tracks.</p>

  <p>The output of the steps below is a set of CSS boxes that covers
  the rendering area of the <a>media element</a> or other
  playback mechanism, which user agents are expected to render in a
  manner suiting the user.</p>

  <p>The rules are as follows:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>If the <a>media element</a> is an <code>audio</code>
   element, or is another playback mechanism with no rendering area,
   abort these steps. There is nothing to render.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">video</var> be the <a>media
   element</a> or other playback mechanism.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">output</var> be an empty list of
   absolutely positioned CSS block boxes.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the user agent is <a title="expose a user interface to
   the user">exposing a user interface</a> for <var
   title="">video</var>, add to <var title="">output</var> one or more
   completely transparent positioned CSS block boxes that cover the
   same region as the user interface.</p>

   <li><p>If the last time these rules were run, the user agent was
   not <a title="expose a user interface to the user">exposing a
   user interface</a> for <var title="">video</var>, but now it is,
   optionally let <var title="">reset</var> be true. Otherwise, let <var
   title="">reset</var> be false.</p>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">tracks</var> be the subset of <var
   title="">video</var>'s <a>list of text tracks</a> that have
   as their <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a>
   these <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text
   tracks</a>, and whose <a>text track mode</a> is <a
   title="text track showing">showing</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var title="">cues</var> be an empty list of <a
   title="text track cue">text track cues</a> and <var title="">regions</var>
   be an empty list of <a title="text track region">text track regions</a>. For each track <var>track</var>
   in <var>tracks</var> append to <var>regions</var> all the <a title="text track region">regions</a> from
   <var>track</var>'s <a>text track list of regions</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>For each track <var title="">track</var> in <var
   title="">tracks</var>, append to <var title="">cues</var> all the
   <a title="text track cue">cues</a> from <var
   title="">track</var>'s <a title="text track list of cues">list
   of cues</a> that have their <a>text track cue active
   flag</a> set.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>reset</var> is false, then, for each <span>text track region</span> <var>region</var> in <var>regions</var> let <var>regionNode</var> be a <a>WebVTT region object</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Apply the following steps for each <var>regionNode</var>:</p>

     <ol>
       <li><p>Prepare some variables  for the application of CSS properties to <var>regionNode</var> as follows:</p>

         <ul>
           <li><p>Let <var>regionWidth</var> be the <a>text track region width</a>. Let <var>width</var> be '<var>regionWidth</var> vw' ('vw' is a CSS unit).<a href="#refsCSSVALUES">[CSSVALUES]</a></p></li>

           <li><p>Let <var>lineHeight</var> be '0.0533vh' ('vh' is a CSS unit).<a href="#refsCSSVALUES">[CSSVALUES]</a> and <var>regionHeight</var> be the <a>text track region lines</a>. Let <var>lines</var> be '<var>lineHeight</var> multiplied by <var>regionHeight</var>.</p></li>

           <li><p>Let <var>viewportAnchorX</var> be the x dimension of the <a>text track region viewport anchor</a> and <var>regionAnchorX</var> be the x dimension of the <a>text track region anchor</a>. Let <var>leftOffset</var> be <var>regionAnchorX</var> multiplied by <var>width</var> divided by 100.0. Let <var>left</var> be <var>leftOffset</var> subtracted from '<var>viewportAnchorX</var> vw'.</p></li>

           <li><p>Let <var>viewportAnchorY</var> be the y dimension of the <a>text track region viewport anchor</a> and <var>regionAnchorY</var> be the y dimension of the <a>text track region anchor</a>. Let <var>topOffset</var> be <var>regionAnchorY</var> multiplied by <var>lines</var> divided by 100.0. Let <var>top</var> be <var>topOffset</var> subtracted from '<var>viewportAnchorY</var> vh'.</p></li>
         </ul>
       </li>

       <li><p>Apply the terms of the CSS specifications to <var>regionNode</var> within the following constraints, thus obtaining a CSS box <var>box</var> positioned relative to an initial containing block:</p>
         <ol>
           <li><p>No style sheets are associated with <var>regionNode</var>. (The regionNodes are subsequently restyled using style sheets after their boxes are generated, as described below.)</p></li>
           <li><p>Properties on <var>regionNode</var> have their values set as defined in the next section. (That section uses some of the variables whose values were calculated earlier in this algorithm.)</p></li>
           <li><p>The viewport (and initial containing block) is video's rendering area.</p></li>
         </ol>
       </li>

       <li><p>Add the CSS box <var>box</var> to <var>output</var>.</p></li>
     </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>If <var>reset</var> is false, then, for each <span>text track cue</span> <var>cue</var> in <var>cues</var>: if <var>cue</var>'s <span>text track cue display state</span> has a set of CSS boxes, then:</p>

     <ul>
       <li><p>if there is a <a>WebVTT region</a> whose <a title="WebVTT region identifier">region identifier</a> is identical to <var>cue</var>'s <a>text track cue region identifier</a>:</p>
      <p>add those boxes to that region's <var>box</var> and remove <var>cue</var> from <var>cues</var>.</p></li>

      <li><p>otherwise:</p>
        <p>add those boxes to <var>output</var> and remove <var>cue</var> from <var>cues</var>.</p></li>
     </ul>

   </li>

   <li>

    <p>For each <a>text track cue</a> <var title="">cue</var>
    in <var title="">cues</var> that has not yet had corresponding CSS
    boxes added to <var title="">output</var>, in <a>text track
    cue order</a>, run the following substeps:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>If <var>cue</var> has an empty <a>text track cue region identifier</a> or there is no <a>WebVTT region</a> whose <a title="text track cue region identifier">region identifier</a> is identical to <var>cue</var>'s <a>text track cue region identifier</a>, run the following substeps:</p>
      
      <ol>

     <li><p>Let <var title="">nodes</var> be the <a>list of WebVTT

     </li>

     <li>

       described below.)</li>

       <li>The children of the <var title="">nodes</var> must be
       wrapped in an anonymous box whose 'display' property has the
       value 'inline'. This is the <dfn>WebVTT cue background

       'ruby-base'. <a href="#refsCSSRUBY">[CSSRUBY]</a></li>

       <li>Properties on <a title="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node
       Objects</a> have their values set as defined in the next

       <li>Text runs must be wrapped according to the CSS
       line-wrapping rules, with the following additional constraints:

        <ul>

         <li>Regardless of the value of the 'white-space' property,
         lines must be wrapped at the edge of their containing blocks,
         even if doing so requires splitting a word where there is no
         line breaking opportunity. (Thus, normally text wraps as
         needed, but if there is a particularly long word, it does not
         overflow as it normally would in CSS, it is instead forcibly
         wrapped at the box's edge.)</li>

         <li>Regardless of the value of the 'white-space' property,
         any line breaks inserted by the user agent for the purposes
         of line wrapping must be placed so as to minimize &Delta;
         across each run of consecutive lines between preserved
         newlines in the source. &Delta; for a set of lines is defined
         as the sum over each line of the absolute of the difference
         between the line's length and the mean line length of the
         set.</li>

  <h4>CSS extensions</h4>

  <p>When a user agent is rendering one or more <a title="text track cue">text track cues</a>
  according to the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>, <a
  title="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a> in the <a>list of WebVTT Node
  Objects</a> used in the rendering can be matched by certain pseudo-selectors as defined below.
  These selectors can begin or stop matching individual <a title="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node
  Objects</a> while a <a title="text track cue">cue</a> is being rendered, even in between
  applications of the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a> (which are
  only run when the set of active cues changes). User agents that support the pseudo-element
  described below must dynamically update renderings accordingly. When either 'white-space' or one
  of the properties corresponding to the 'font' shorthand (including 'line-height') changes value,
  then the <a>text track cue</a>'s <a>text track cue display state</a> must be emptied
  and the <a>text track</a>'s <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> must be
  immediately rerun.</p>

  <p>Pseudo-elements apply to elements that are matched by
  selectors. For the purpose of this section, that element is the
  <i>matched element</i>. The pseudo-elements defined in the following
  sections affect the styling of parts of <a title="text track
  cue">text track cues</a> that are being rendered for the
  <i>matched element</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">If the <i>matched element</i> is not a
  <code>video</code> element, the pseudo-elements defined below won't
  have any effect according to this specification.</p>

  <p>A CSS user agent that implements the <a title="text
  track">text tracks</a> model must implement the '::cue' and
  '::cue(<var title="">selector</var>)' pseudo-elements, and the <a
  title="past-pseudo-class">':past'</a> and <a
  title="future-pseudo-class">':future'</a> pseudo-classes.</p>

  <h5>The '::cue' pseudo-element</h5>

  <p>The '<dfn title="pseudo-cue">::cue</dfn>' pseudo-element (with no
  argument) matches any <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>
  constructed for the <i>matched element</i>, with the exception that
  the properties corresponding to the 'background' shorthand must be
  applied to the <a>WebVTT cue background box</a> rather than
  the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>.</p>

  <p>The following properties apply to the '::cue' pseudo-element with
  no argument; other properties set on the pseudo-element must be
  ignored:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li>'color'</li>
   <li>'opacity'</li>
   <li>'visibility'</li>
   <li>'text-decoration'</li>

  </ul>

  <p>The '<dfn title="pseudo-cue-selector">::cue(<var

  have an argument that consists of a group of selectors. It matches
  any <a>WebVTT Internal Node Object</a> constructed for the

   <!-- add more... -->
   <!-- but definitely not anything that affects dimensions of boxes, e.g. the 'font' shorthand's properties or 'white-space'; those are listed below instead -->
  </ul>

  <!--v2
   Would be nice to support transitions that are directional,
   e.g. changing text fill colour or shadow size of the start of a

   propagate towards the end of the segment so that it reaches the end
   of the segment when the next segment becomes "past".

  <p>Properties that do not apply must be ignored.</p>

  <p>As a special exception, the properties corresponding to the

   <dt>Security considerations:</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Text track files themselves pose no immediate risk unless
    sensitive information is included within the
    data. Implementations, however, are required to follow specific
    rules when processing text tracks, to ensure that certain
    origin-based restrictions are honored. Failure to correctly
    implement these rules can result in information leakage,
    cross-site scripting attacks, and the like.</p>
