Abstract: This specification defines WebVTT, the Web Video Text Tracks format. Its main use is for marking up external text track resources in connection with the HTML &lt;track> element.
Abstract: WebVTT files provide captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions [[MAUR]], chapters for content navigation, and more generally any form of metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.
Boilerplate: omit conformance, omit feedback-header
Ignored Terms: unicode-bidi, color, text-combine-upright, text-wrap, lang, class, title
Ignored Vars: seconds-frac, selector, fragment, seen cue

<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT</dfn> (Web Video Text Tracks) format is intended for marking up external text
track resources.</p>

<p>The main use for WebVTT files is captioning or subtitling video content. Here is a sample file
that captions an interview:</p>

<pre>
WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We are in New York City

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>We're actually at the Lucern Hotel, just down the street

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>from the American Museum of Natural History

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And with me is Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Astrophysicist, Director of the Hayden Planetarium

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>at the AMNH.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>Thank you for walking down here.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>And I want to do a follow-up on the last conversation we did.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.500 align:right size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>When we e-mailed&mdash;

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500 align:left size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>Didn't we talk about enough in that conversation?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.500 align:right size:50%
&lt;v Roger Bingham>No! No no no no; 'cos 'cos obviously 'cos

00:32.500 --> 00:33.500 align:left size:50%
&lt;v Neil deGrasse Tyson>&lt;i>Laughs&lt;/i>

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
&lt;v Roger Bingham>You know I'm so excited my glasses are falling off here.
</pre>

<h3 id=introduction-multiple-lines>Cues with multiple lines</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>Line breaks in cues are honored. User agents will also insert extra line breaks if necessary to
fit the cue in the cue's width. In general, therefore, authors are encouraged to write cues all on
one line except when a line break is definitely necessary.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>These captions on a public service announcement video demonstrate line breaking:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
 Never drink liquid nitrogen.

 00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
 &mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
 &mdash; You could die.

 00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 The Organisation for Sample Public Service Announcements accepts no liability for the content of this advertisement, or for the consequences of any actions taken on the basis of the information provided.
 </pre>

 <p>The first cue is simple, it will probably just display on one line. The second will take two
 lines, one for each speaker. The third will wrap to fit the width of the video, possibly taking
 multiple lines. For example, the three cues could look like this:</p>

 <!-- 50 -->
 <pre>
 &nbsp;          <samp>Never drink liquid nitrogen.</samp>

         <samp>&mdash; It will perforate your stomach.</samp>
                 <samp>&mdash; You could die.</samp>

     <samp>The Organisation for Sample Public Service</samp>
     <samp>Announcements accepts no liability for the</samp>
     <samp>content of this advertisement, or for the</samp>
      <samp>consequences of any actions taken on the</samp>
         <samp>basis of the information provided.</samp>
 </pre>

 <p>If the width of the cues is smaller, the first two cues could wrap as well, as in the following
 example. Note how the second cue's explicit line break is still honored, however:</p>

 <!-- 25 -->
 <pre>
 &nbsp;     <samp>Never drink</samp>
     <samp>liquid nitrogen.</samp>

   <samp>&mdash; It will perforate</samp>
       <samp>your stomach.</samp>
     <samp>&mdash; You could die.</samp>

   <samp>The Organisation for</samp>
   <samp>Sample Public Service</samp>
   <samp>Announcements accepts</samp>
   <samp>no liability for the</samp>
      <samp>content of this</samp>
   <samp>advertisement, or for</samp>
    <samp>the consequences of</samp>
   <samp>any actions taken on</samp>
     <samp>the basis of the</samp>
   <samp>information provided.</samp>
 </pre>

 <p>Also notice how the wrapping is done so as to keep the line lengths balanced.</p>

</div>

<h3 id=introduction-comments>Comments</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>Comments can be included in WebVTT files.</p>

<p>Comments are just blocks that are preceded by a blank line, start with the word
"<code>NOTE</code>" (followed by a space or newline), and end at the first blank line.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>Here, a one-line comment is used to note a possible problem with a cue.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
 Never drink liquid nitrogen.

 NOTE I'm not sure the timing is right on the following cue.

 00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
 &mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
 &mdash; You could die.
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, the author has written many comments.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 NOTE
 This file was written by Jill. I hope
 you enjoy reading it. Some things to
 bear in mind:
 - I was lip-reading, so the cues may
 not be 100% accurate
 - I didn't pay too close attention to
 when the cues should start or end.

 00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
 Never drink liquid nitrogen.

 NOTE check next cue

 00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
 &mdash; It will perforate your stomach.
 &mdash; You could die.

 NOTE end of file
 </pre>

</div>

<h3 id=styling>Styling</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>CSS stylesheets that apply to an HTML page that contains a <a spec=html element>video</a> element
can target WebVTT cues and regions in the video using the ''::cue'', ''::cue()'' and
''::cue-region'' pseudo-elements.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, an HTML page has a CSS stylesheet in a <a spec=html element>style</a> element
 that styles all cues in the video with a gradient background and a text color, as well as changing
 the text color for all <a>WebVTT Bold Objects</a> in cues in the video.</p>

 <pre>
 &lt;!doctype html>
 &lt;html>
  &lt;head>
   &lt;title>Styling WebVTT cues&lt;/title>
   &lt;style>
    video::cue {
      background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
      color: papayawhip;
    }
    video::cue(b) {
      color: peachpuff;
    }
   &lt;/style>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
   &lt;video controls autoplay src="video.webm">
    &lt;track default src="track.vtt">
   &lt;/video>
  &lt;/body>
 &lt;/html>
 </pre>

</div>

<p>CSS stylesheets can also be embedded in WebVTT files themselves.</p>

<p>Style blocks are placed after any headers but before the first cue, and start with the line
"STYLE". Comment blocks can be interleaved with style blocks.</p>

<p>Blank lines cannot appear in the stylesheet. They can be removed or be filled with a space or a
CSS comment (e.g. <code>/**/</code>).</p>

<p>The string "<code>--></code>" cannot be used in the stylesheet. If the stylesheet is wrapped in
"<code>&lt;!--</code>" and "<code>--></code>", then those strings can just be removed. If
"<code>--></code>" appears inside a CSS string, then it can use CSS escaping e.g.
"<code>--\></code>".</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>This example shows how cues can be styled with style blocks in WebVTT.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 STYLE
 ::cue {
   background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
   color: papayawhip;
 }
 /* Style blocks cannot use blank lines nor "dash dash greater than" */

 NOTE comment blocks can be used between style blocks.

 STYLE
 ::cue(b) {
   color: peachpuff;
 }

 hello
 00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hello &lt;b>world&lt;/b>.

 NOTE style blocks cannot appear after the first cue.
 </pre>

 </div>

<h3 id=introduction-other-features>Other features</h3>

<p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

<p>WebVTT also supports some less-often used features.</p>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, the cues have an identifier:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 1
 00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 That's an, an, that's an L!

 crédit de transcription
 00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
 Transcrit par Célestes&trade;
 </pre>

 <p>This allows a style sheet to specifically target the cues (notice the use of CSS character
 escape sequences):</p>

 <pre>
 ::cue(#\31) { color: lime; }
 ::cue(#crédit\ de\ transcription) { color: red; }
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

 <p>This example shows how classes can be used on elements, which can be helpful for localization or
 maintainability of styling, and also how to indicate a language change in the cue text.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 04:02.500 --> 04:05.000
 J'ai commencé le basket à l'âge de 13, 14 ans

 04:05.001 --> 04:07.800
 Sur les &lt;i.foreignphrase>&lt;lang en>playground&lt;/lang>&lt;/i>, ici à Montpellier
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">

 <p>In this example, each cue says who is talking using voice spans. In the first cue, the span
 specifying the speaker is also annotated with two classes, "first" and "loud". In the third cue,
 there is also some italics text (not associated with a specific speaker). The last cue is annotated
 with just the class "loud".</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 &lt;v.first.loud Esme>It's a blue apple tree!

 00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 &lt;v Mary>No way!

 00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 &lt;v Esme>Hee!&lt;/v> &lt;i>laughter&lt;/i>

 00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 &lt;v.loud Mary>That's awesome!
 </pre>

 <p>Notice that as a special exception, the voice spans don't have to be closed if they cover the
 entire cue text.</p>

 <p>Style sheets can style these spans:</p>

 <pre>
 ::cue(v[voice="Esme"]) { color: cyan }
 ::cue(v[voice="Mary"]) { color: lime }
 ::cue(i) { font-style: italic }
 ::cue(.loud) { font-size: 2em }
 </pre>

</div>

<div class="example">
 <p>This example shows how to position cues at explicit positions in the video viewport.</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000 position:10%,line-left align:left size:35%
 Where did he go?

 00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:90% align:right size:35%
 I think he went down this lane.

 00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:45%,line-right align:center size:35%
 What are you waiting for?
 </pre>

 <p>Since the cues in these examples are horizontal, the "position" setting refers to a percentage
 of the width of the video viewpoint. If the text were vertical, the "position" setting would refer
 to the height of the viewport.</p>

 <p>The "line-left" or "line-right" only refers to the physical side of the box to which the
 "position" setting applies, in a way which is agnostic regarding the horizontal or vertical
 direction of the cue. It does not affect or relate to the direction or position of the text itself
 within the box.</p>

 <p>The cues cover only 35% of the video viewport's width - that's the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue
 box</a>'s "size" for all three cues.</p>

 <p>The first cue has its <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> positioned at the 10% mark. The
 "line-left" and "line-right" within the "position" setting indicates which side of the <a
 lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> the position refers to. Since in this case the text is horizontal,
 "line-left" refers to the left side of the box, and the cue box is thus positioned between the 10%
 and the 45% mark of the video viewport's width, probably underneath a speaker on the left of the
 video image. If the cue was vertical, "line-left" positioning would be from the top of the video
 viewport's height and the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> would cover 35% of the video
 viewport's height.</p>

 <p>The text within the first cue's cue box is aligned using the "align" cue setting. For
 left-to-right rendered text, "start" alignment is the left of that box, for right-to-left rendered
 text the right of the box. So, independent of the directionality of the text, it will stay
 underneath that speaker. Note that "center" position alignment of the cue box is the default for
 start aligned text, in order to avoid having the box move when the base direction of the text
 changes (from left-to-right to right-to-left or vice versa) as a result of translation.</p>

 <p>The second cue has its <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> right aligned at the 90% mark of the
 video viewport width ("right" aligned text right aligns the box). The same effect can be achieved
 with "position:55%,line-left", which explicitly positions the cue box. The third cue has center
 aligned text within the same positioned cue box as the first cue.</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
 <p>This example shows two regions containing rollup captions for two different speakers. Fred's
 cues scroll up in a region in the left half of the video, Bill's cues scroll up in a region on the
 right half of the video. Fred's first cue disappears at 12.5sec even though it is defined until
 20sec because its region is limited to 3 lines and at 12.5sec a fourth cue appears:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 REGION

 00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:22.500 region:bill align:right
 &lt;v Bill>Hi, I'm Bill

 00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:25.000 region:fred align:left
 &lt;v Fred>Would you like to get a coffee?

 00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:27.500 region:bill align:right
 &lt;v Bill>Sure! I've only had one today.

 00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:30.000 region:fred align:left
 &lt;v Fred>This is my fourth!

 00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:32.500 region:fred align:left
 &lt;v Fred>OK, let's go.
 </pre>

 <p>Note that regions are only defined for horizontal cues.</p>

</div>


<h2 id=conformance>Conformance</h2>

<p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative
parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in
the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY"
and "OPTIONAL". For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this
specification. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

<p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space
characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

<p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>


<h3 id=conformance-classes>Conformance classes</h3>

<p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for user agents (relevant to implementors)
and <a>WebVTT files</a> (relevant to authors and authoring tool implementors).</p>

<p class=note>[[#syntax]] defines what consists of a valid <a>WebVTT file</a>. Authors need to
follow the requirements therein, and are encouraged to use a conformance checker. [[#parsing]]
defines how user agents are to interpret a file labelled as <a>text/vtt</a>, for both valid and
invalid <a>WebVTT files</a>. The parsing rules are more tolerant to author errors than the syntax
allows, in order to provide for extensibility and to still render cues that have some syntax
errors.</p>

<p class=example>For example, the parser will create two cues even if the blank line between them is
skipped. This is clearly a mistake, so a conformance checker will flag it as an error, but it is
still useful to render the cues to the user.</p>

<p>User agents fall into several (possibly overlapping) categories with different conformance
requirements.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>User agents that support scripting</dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply. The user agent must also be
 conforming implementations of the IDL fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL
 specification. [[!WEBIDL]]</p></dd>

 <dt>User agents with no scripting support</dt>
 <dd><p>All processing requirements in this specification apply, except those in [[#api]].</p></dd>

 <dt>Conformance checkers</dt>
 <dd><p>Conformance checkers must verify that a <a>WebVTT file</a> conforms to the applicable
 conformance criteria described in this specification. The term "validator" is equivalent to
 conformance checker for the purpose of this specification.</p></dd>

 <dt>Authoring tools</dt>
 <dd>
  <p>Authoring tools must generate conforming <a>WebVTT files</a>. Tools that convert other formats
  to <a>WebVTT</a> are also considered to be authoring tools.</p>

  <p>When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming <a>WebVTT file</a>, it may preserve the
  conformance errors in sections of the file that were not edited during the editing session (i.e.
  an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool must not
  claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.</p>
 </dd>
</dl>


<h3 id=unicode-normalization>Unicode normalization</h3>

<p>Implementations of this specification must not normalize Unicode text during processing.</p>

<p class=example>For example, a cue with an identifier consisting of the characters U+0041 LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER A followed by U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE (a decomposed character sequence), or the
character U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN (a compatibility character), will not match a selector targeting a
cue with an ID consisting of the character U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (a
precomposed character).</p>


<h2 id=data-model>Data model</h2>
<!-- Add some content here about cues and serialisation format in general -->
<!-- Describe metadata, caption/subtitle, chapter & description cues -->


<h3 id=cues>WebVTT cues</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT cue</dfn> is a <a>text track cue</a> that additionally consist of the following:
[[!HTML]]</p>

<dl>

 <dt><dfn lt="WebVTT cue box">A cue box</dfn></dt>
 <dd>
  <p>The cue box of a <a>WebVTT cue</a> is a box within which the text of all lines of the cue is to
  be rendered.</p>

  <p class="note">The position of the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> within the video viewport's
  dimensions depends on the value of the <a>WebVTT cue position</a> and the <a>WebVTT cue
  line</a>.</p>

  <p class=note>The base direction of each line in a cue (which is used by the Unicode Bidirectional
  Algorithm to determine the order in which to display the characters in the line) is determined by
  looking up the first strong directional character in each line, using the CSS

  a line would produce the wrong base direction for that line, the author can use an U+200E
  LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK or U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK character at the start of the line to correct it.
  [[BIDI]]</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, the second cue will have a right-to-left base direction, rendering as
   "<samp><bdo dir=ltr>.I think ,&#x064A;&#x0644;&#x0627;&#x0639;</bdo></samp>". (Note that the text
   below shows all characters left-to-right; a text editor would not necessarily have the same
   rendering.)</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
   What was his name again?

   00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
   <bdo dir=ltr>&#x0639;&#x0627;&#x0644;&#x064A;, I think.</bdo>
   </pre>

   <p>To change that line to left-to-right base direction, start the line with an U+200E
   LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK character (it can be escaped as "<code>&amp;lrm;</code>").</p>
  </div>

  <p class=note>Where the base direction of some embedded text within a line needs to be different
  from the surrounding text on that line, this can be achieved by using the paired Unicode bidi
  formatting code characters.</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, assuming no bidi formatting code characters are used, the cue text is
   rendered as "<samp><bdo dir=ltr>I've read the book 3 &#x5D3;&#x5E0;&#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D5;&#x5E0;
   times!</bdo></samp>" (i.e. the "3" is on the wrong side of the book title) because of the effect
   of the Unicode Bidirection Algorithm. (Again, the text below shows all characters
   left-to-right.)</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
   <bdo dir=ltr>I've read the book &#x5E0;&#x5D5;&#x5D9;&#x5DC;&#x5E0;&#x5D3; 3 times!</bdo>
   </pre>

   <p>If a U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE (FSI) character was placed before the book title and a U+2069
   POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE (PDI) character after it, the rendering would be the intended "<samp><bdo
   dir=ltr>I've read the book &#x5D3;&#x5E0;&#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D5;&#x5E0; 3 times!</bdo></samp>".
   (Those characters can be escaped as "<code>&amp;#x2068;</code>" and "<code>&amp;#x2069;</code>",
   respectively.)</p>
  </div>

  <p class=note>The default text alignment is <a lt="WebVTT cue center alignment">center
  alignment</a> regardless of the base direction of the cue text. To make the text alignment of each
  line match the base direction of the line (e.g. left for English, right for Hebrew), use <a
  lt="WebVTT cue start alignment">start alignment</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT cue end alignment">end
  alignment</a> for the opposite alignment.</p>

  <div class=example>
   <p>In this example, <a lt="WebVTT cue start alignment">start alignment</a> is used. The first
   line is left-aligned because the base direction is left-to-right, and the second line is
   right-aligned because the base direction is right-to-left.</p>

   <pre>
   WEBVTT

   00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 align:start
   Hello!
   <bdo dir=ltr>&#x5E9;&#x5DC;&#x5D5;&#x5DD;!</bdo>

   <p>This would render as follows:</p>

 <p><img src="webvtt-region-diagram.png" alt="Within the video viewport, there is a WebVTT region.
 Inside the region, there is an anchor point marked with a black cross. The vertical and horizontal
 distance from the video viewport's edges to the anchor is marked with green arrows, representing
 the region viewport anchor X and Y offsets. The vertical and horizontal distance from the region's

<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region viewport anchor setting</a> provides a tuple of two percentages
that specify the point within the video viewport that the region anchor point is anchored to. The
first percentage measures the x-dimension and the second percentage measures the y-dimension from
the top left corner of the video viewport box. If no viewport anchor is given, it defaults to 0%,
100% (i.e. the bottom left corner).</p>

<p class="note">For browsers, the region maps to an absolute positioned CSS box relative to the
video viewport, i.e. there is a relative positioned box that represents the video viewport relative
to which the regions are absolutely positioned. Overflow is hidden.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region scroll setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>scroll</code>".</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>The string "<code>up</code>".</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="note">The <a>WebVTT region scroll setting</a> specifies whether cues rendered into the
region are allowed to move out of their initial rendering place and roll up, i.e. move towards the
top of the video viewport. If the scroll setting is omitted, cues do not move from their rendered
position.</p>

<p class="note">Cues are added to a region one line at a time below existing cue lines. When an
existing rendered cue line is removed, and it was above another already rendered cue line, that cue
line moves into its space, thus scrolling in the given direction. If there is not enough space for a
new cue line to be added to a region, the top-most cue line is pushed off the visible region (thus
slowly becoming invisible as it moves into overflow:hidden). This eventually makes space for the new
cue line and allows it to be added.</p>

<p class="note">When there is no scroll direction, cue lines are added in the empty line closest to
the line in the bottom of the region. If no empty line is available, the oldest line is
replaced.</p>


<h3 id=cue-settings>WebVTT cue settings</h3>

<p>A <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> consists of zero or more of the following settings. Each
setting must not be included more than once per <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a>.</p>

<ul class="brief">
 <li>A <a>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT size cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT alignment cue setting</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a>WebVTT region cue setting</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT cue settings list</a> gives configuration options regarding the position
and alignment of the cue box and the cue text within. For example, it allows a cue box to be aligned
to the left or positioned at the top right with the cue text within center aligned.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT cue setting</a> that consists of the
following components, in the order given:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The string "<code>vertical</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>One of the following strings as the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: "<code>rl</code>",
 "<code>lr</code>".</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT vertical text cue setting</a> configures the cue to use vertical text
layout rather than horizontal text layout. Vertical text layout is sometimes used in Japanese, for
example. The default is horizontal layout.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT line cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>line</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>

     <dd>
      <p>A <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p>
     </dd>
     <dt>Or to represent a line number</dt>
     <dd>
      <ol>
       <li>Optionally a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-).</li>
       <li>One or more <a>ASCII digits</a>.</li>
      </ol>
     </dd>

     "<code>end</code>"</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a> configures the offset of the cue box from the video
viewport's edge in the direction opposite to the <a lt="WebVTT cue writing direction">writing
direction</a>. For horizontal cues, this is the vertical offset from the top of the video viewport.
The offset is for the <a lt="WebVTT cue line start alignment">start</a>, <a lt="WebVTT cue line
center alignment">center</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT cue line end alignment">end</a> of the cue box,
depending on the <a>WebVTT cue line alignment</a> value - <a lt="WebVTT cue line start
alignment">start</a> by default. The offset can be given either as a percentage of the video
dimension or as a line number. Line numbers are based on the size of the first line of the cue.
Positive line numbers count from the start of the video viewport (the first line is numbered 0),
negative line numbers from the end of the viewport (the last line is numbered &#x2212;1).</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT position cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>position</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>
  As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>:
  <ol>
   <li>a position value consisting of: a <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</li>

     <li>A U+002C COMMA character (,).</li>
     <li>One of the following strings: "<code>line-left</code>", "<code>center</code>",
     "<code>line-right</code>"</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a> configures the indent position of the <a
lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a> in the direction orthogonal to the <a>WebVTT line cue setting</a>.
For horizontal cues, this is the horizontal position. The cue position is given as a percentage of
the video viewport. The positioning is for the <a lt="WebVTT cue position line-left
alignment">line-left</a>, <a lt="WebVTT cue position center alignment">center</a>, or <a lt="WebVTT
cue position line-right alignment">line-right</a> of the cue box, depending on the cue's <a lt="cue
computed position alignment">computed position alignment</a>, which is overridden by the <a>WebVTT
position cue setting</a>.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT size cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>size</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li><p>As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: a <a>WebVTT percentage</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT size cue setting</a> configures the size of the <a lt="WebVTT cue
box">cue box</a> in the same direction as the <a>WebVTT position cue setting</a>. For horizontal
cues, this is the width of the <a lt="WebVTT cue box">cue box</a>. It is given as a percentage of
the width of the viewport.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT alignment cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>align</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>
 <li><p>A U+003A COLON character (:).</p></li>
 <li>One of the following strings as the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: "<code>start</code>",
 "<code>center</code>", "<code>end</code>", "<code>left</code>", "<code>right</code>"</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT alignment cue setting</a> configures the alignment of the text within
the cue. The "<code>start</code>" and "<code>end</code>" keywords are relative to the cue text's
lines' base direction; for left-to-right English text, "<code>start</code>" means left-aligned.</p>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT region cue setting</dfn> consists of the following components, in the order
given:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>The string "<code>region</code>" as the <a>WebVTT cue setting name</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>As the <a>WebVTT cue setting value</a>: an arbitrary string of one or more characters other
 than U+0020 SPACE or U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION character. The string must not contain the
 substring "<code>--></code>" (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E GREATER-THAN
 SIGN).</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">A <a>WebVTT region cue setting</a> configures a cue to become part of a region by
referencing the region's identifier unless the cue has a <a lt="WebVTT vertical text cue
setting">"vertical"</a>, <a lt="WebVTT line cue setting">"line"</a> or <a lt="WebVTT size cue

applied to the line boxes in the cue relative to the region box.</p>


<h3 id=properties-of-cue-sequences>Properties of cue sequences</h3>


<h4 id=file-using-only-nested-cues>WebVTT file using only nested cues</h4>

<p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all follow the following rules is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file
using only nested cues</dfn>:</p>

<p>given any two cues |cue1| and |cue2| with start and end time offsets (|x1|, |y1|) and (|x2|,
|y2|) respectively,</p>

<ul>
 <li>either |cue1| lies fully within |cue2|, i.e. |x1| >= |x2| and |y1| &lt;= |y2|</li>
 <li>or |cue1| fully contains |cue2|, i.e. |x1| &lt;= |x2| and |y1| >= |y2|.</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">

 <p>The following example matches this definition:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 01:24.000
 Introduction

 00:00.000 --> 00:44.000
 Topics

 00:44.000 --> 01:19.000
 Presenters

 01:24.000 --> 05:00.000
 Scrolling Effects

 01:35.000 --> 03:00.000
 Achim's Demo

 03:00.000 --> 05:00.000
 Timeline Panel
 </pre>

 <p>Notice how you can express the cues in this WebVTT file as a tree structure:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   WebVTT file
   <ul>
    <li>
     Introduction
     <ul>
      <li>Topics</li>
      <li>Presenters</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Scrolling Effects
     <ul>

      <li>Timeline Panel</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>If the file has cues that can't be expressed in this fashion, then they don't match the
 definition of a <a>WebVTT file using only nested cues</a>. For example:</p>

 <pre>
 WEBVTT

 00:00.000 --> 01:00.000
 The First Minute

 00:30.000 --> 01:30.000
 The Final Minute
 </pre>

 <p>In this ninety-second example, the two cues partly overlap, with the first ending before the
 second ends and the second starting before the first ends. This therefore is not a <a>WebVTT file
 using only nested cues</a>.</p>

</div>


<h3 id=types-of-webvtt-files>Types of WebVTT files</h3>

<p>The syntax definition of WebVTT files allows authoring of a wide variety of WebVTT files with a
mix of cues. However, only a small subset of WebVTT file types are typically authored.</p>

<p>Conformance checkers, when validating <a>WebVTT files</a>, may offer to restrict syntax checking
for validating these types.</p>


<h4 id=file-using-metadata-content>WebVTT file using metadata content</h4>

<p>A <a>WebVTT file</a> whose cues all have a <a>cue payload</a> that is <a>WebVTT metadata text</a>
is said to be a <dfn>WebVTT file using metadata content</dfn>.</p>


<h4 id=file-using-chapter-title-text>WebVTT file using chapter title text</h4>

<p><dfn>WebVTT chapter title text</dfn> is <a>WebVTT cue text</a> that makes use only of zero or
more of the following components, each optionally separated from the next by a <a>WebVTT line
terminator</a>:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a>WebVTT cue text span</a></li>
 <li><a spec=html lt="character references">HTML character reference</a> [[!HTML]]</li>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT file using chapter title text</dfn> is a <a>WebVTT file using only nested cues</a>

<h2 id=parsing>Parsing</h2>


<h3 id=file-parsing algorithm>WebVTT file parsing</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT parser</dfn>, given an input byte stream, a <a>text track list of cues</a>
|output|, and a collection of <a spec=cssom>CSS style sheets</a> |stylesheets|, must decode the byte
stream using the <a lt="UTF-8 decode">UTF-8 decode</a> algorithm, and then must parse the resulting
string according to the <a>WebVTT parser algorithm</a> below. This results in <a>WebVTT cues</a>
being added to |output|, and <a spec=cssom>CSS style sheets</a> being added to |stylesheets|.
[[!RFC3629]]</p>

<p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a>, specifically its conversion and parsing steps, is typically run
asynchronously, with the input byte stream being updated incrementally as the resource is
downloaded; this is called an <dfn>incremental WebVTT parser</dfn>.</p>

<p>A <a>WebVTT parser</a> verifies a file signature before parsing the provided byte stream. If the
stream lacks this WebVTT file signature, then the parser aborts.</p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT parser algorithm</dfn> is as follows:</p>

<ol>

 <li>
  <p>Let |input| be the string being parsed, after conversion to Unicode, and with the following
  transformations applied:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>Replace all U+0000 NULL characters by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace each U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair by a single
   U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character.</p></li>

   <li><p>Replace all remaining U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters by U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
   characters.</p></li>

  </ul>

 </li>

 <li><p>Let |position| be a pointer into |input|, initially pointing at the start of the string. In
 an <a>incremental WebVTT parser</a>, when this algorithm (or further algorithms that it uses) moves
 the |position| pointer, the user agent must wait until appropriate further characters from the byte
 stream have been added to |input| before moving the pointer, so that the algorithm never reads past
 the end of the |input| string. Once the byte stream has ended, and all characters have been added
 to |input|, then the |position| pointer may, when so instructed by the algorithms, be moved past
 the end of |input|.</p></li>

 <li>Let |seen cue| be false.</li>

 <!-- SIGNATURE CHECK -->

 <li><p>If |input| is less than six characters long, then abort these steps. The file does not start
 with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not successfully
 processed.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |input| is exactly six characters long but does not exactly equal "<code>WEBVTT</code>",
 then abort these steps. The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and
 was therefore not successfully processed.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |input| is more than six characters long but the first six characters do not exactly
 equal "<code>WEBVTT</code>", or the seventh character is not a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009
 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, or a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, then abort these steps.
 The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVTT file</a> signature and was therefore not
 successfully processed.</p></li>

 <li><p><a spec=html>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are <em>not</em> U+000A LINE FEED

 <li><p><a spec=html>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are U+000A LINE FEED (LF)

</ol>

<p>When the algorithm above says to <dfn>collect a WebVTT block</dfn>, optionally with a flag <i>in

<h3 id=cue-text-parsing-rules algorithm>WebVTT cue text parsing rules</h3>

<p>A <dfn>WebVTT Node Object</dfn> is a conceptual construct used to represent components of
<a>WebVTT cue text</a> so that its processing can be described without reference to the underlying
syntax.</p>

<p>There are two broad classes of <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a>: <a lt="WebVTT
Internal Node Object">WebVTT Internal Node Objects</a> and <a lt="WebVTT Leaf Node Object">WebVTT
Leaf Node Objects</a>.</p>

<p><dfn lt="WebVTT Internal Node Object">WebVTT Internal Node Objects</dfn> are those that can
contain further <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a>. They are conceptually similar to
elements in HTML or the DOM. <a lt="WebVTT Internal Node Object">WebVTT Internal Node Objects</a>
have an ordered list of child <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a>. The <a>WebVTT
Internal Node Object</a> is said to be the <i>parent</i> of the children. Cycles do not occur; the
parent-child relationships so constructed form a tree structure. <a lt="WebVTT Internal Node
Object">WebVTT Internal Node Objects</a> also have an ordered list of class names, known as their
<dfn lt="WebVTT Node Object's applicable classes">applicable classes</dfn>, and a language, known as
their <dfn lt="WebVTT Node Object's applicable language">applicable language</dfn>, which is to be
interpreted as a BCP 47 language tag. [[!BCP47]]</p>

<p class=note>User agents will add a language tag as the <a lt="WebVTT Node Object's applicable
language">applicable language</a> even if it is not a valid or not even well-formed language tag.
[[!BCP47]]</p>

</dl>

<p><dfn lt="WebVTT Leaf Node Object">WebVTT Leaf Node Objects</dfn> are those that contain data,

</dl>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT cue text parsing rules</dfn> consist of the following algorithm. The input is a
string |input| supposedly containing <a>WebVTT cue text</a>, and optionally a fallback language
|language|. This algorithm returns a <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>.</p>

<ol>

 <li><p>Let |input| be the string being parsed.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |position| be a pointer into |input|, initially pointing at the start of the

 <li><p>Let |result| be a <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>, initially empty.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |current| be the <a>WebVTT Internal Node Object</a> |result|.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |language| is set, set |result|'s <a lt="WebVTT Node Object's applicable

 stack|.</p></li>

 <li><p><i>Loop</i>: If |position| is past the end of |input|, return |result| and abort these

 <li><p>Let |token| be the result of invoking the <a>WebVTT cue text tokenizer</a>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Create a <a>WebVTT Text Object</a> whose value is the value of the string token

    </ol>

   </dd>

   <dt>If |token| is a start tag</dt>

    <ol>

     <li><p>Create a new <a>WebVTT Internal Node Object</a> of the specified concrete

<p>When the algorithm above says to attempt to <dfn>consume an HTML character reference</dfn>, it
means to attempt to <a spec=html>consume a character reference</a> as defined in HTML. [[!HTML]]</p>

<p>When the HTML specification says to consume a character, in this context, it means to advance
|position| to the next character in |input|. When it says to unconsume a character, it means to move
|position| back to the previous character in |input|. "EOF" is equivalent to the end-of-file marker
in this specification. Finally, this context is <em>not</em> "as part of an attribute" (when it
comes to handling a missing semicolon).</p>

<p>The <dfn>WebVTT rules for extracting the chapter title</dfn> for a <a>WebVTT cue</a> |cue| are as
follows:</p>

<ol>

 <li><p>Let |nodes| be the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> obtained by applying the <a>WebVTT cue
 text parsing rules</a> to the |cue|'s <a>text track cue text</a>.</p></li>

 pre-order, depth-first traversal, excluding <a lt="WebVTT Ruby Text Object">WebVTT Ruby Text
 Objects</a> and their descendants.</p></li>

</ol>


<h2 id=rendering>Rendering</h2>

<p class="note">This section describes in some detail how to visually render WebVTT cues in a user
agent. It also specifies extra CSS functionality made available to manipulate the visual rendering.
The processing model is quite tightly linked to media elements in HTML. When supporting WebVTT in
media players that don't support CSS, equivalent visual rendering will need to be implemented.</p>


<h3 id=processing-model algorithm>Processing model</h3>

<p>The <dfn>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</dfn> render the <a lt="text
track">text tracks</a> of a <a>media element</a> (specifically, a <a element>video</a> element), or
of another playback mechanism, by applying the steps below. All the <a lt="text track">text
tracks</a> that use these rules for a given <a>media element</a>, or other playback mechanism, are
rendered together, to avoid overlapping subtitles from multiple tracks. A fallback language
|language| may be set when calling this algorithm.</p>

<p class="note">In HTML, audio elements don't have a visual rendering area and therefore, this
algorithm will abort for audio elements. When authors do create WebVTT captions or subtitles for
audio resources, they need to publish them in a video element for rendering by the user agent.</p>

<p>The output of the steps below is a set of CSS boxes that covers the rendering area of the
<a>media element</a> or other playback mechanism, which user agents are expected to render in a
manner suiting the user.</p>

<p>The rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>

 <li><p>If the <a>media element</a> is an <a element>audio</a> element, or is another playback
 mechanism with no rendering area, abort these steps.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |video| be the <a>media element</a> or other playback mechanism.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |output| be an empty list of absolutely positioned CSS block boxes.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the user agent is <a lt="expose a user interface to the user">exposing a user
 interface</a> for |video|, add to |output| one or more completely transparent positioned CSS block
 boxes that cover the same region as the user interface.</p></li>

 <li><p>If the last time these rules were run, the user agent was not <a lt="expose a user interface
 to the user">exposing a user interface</a> for |video|, but now it is, optionally let |reset| be
 true. Otherwise, let |reset| be false.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |tracks| be the subset of |video|'s <a>list of text tracks</a> that have as their
 <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> these <a>rules for updating the display of
 WebVTT text tracks</a>, and whose <a>text track mode</a> is <a lt="text track
 showing">showing</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |cues| be an empty list of <a lt="text track cue">text track cues</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>For each track |track| in |tracks|, append to |cues| all the <a lt="text track cue">cues</a>
 from |track|'s <a lt="text track list of cues">list of cues</a> that have their <a>text track cue
 active flag</a> set.</p></li>

 <li><p>Let |regions| be an empty list of <a lt="WebVTT region">WebVTT regions</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>For each track |track| in |tracks|, append to |regions| all the <a lt="WebVTT
 region">regions</a> from |track|'s <a lt="text track list of regions">list of regions</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p>If |reset| is false, then, for each <a>WebVTT region</a> |region| in |regions| let
 |regionNode| be a <a>WebVTT region object</a>.</p></li>

 <li>
  <p>Apply the following steps for each |regionNode|:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Prepare some variables for the application of CSS properties to |regionNode| as follows:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>Let |regionWidth| be the <a>WebVTT region width</a>. Let |width| be '|regionWidth| vw'
     (''vw'' is a CSS unit). [[!CSS-VALUES]]</p></li>

     <li><p>Let |lineHeight| be '5.33vh' (''vh'' is a CSS unit) [[!CSS-VALUES]] and |regionHeight|
     be the <a>WebVTT region lines</a>. Let |lines| be '|lineHeight| multiplied by
     |regionHeight|.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let |viewportAnchorX| be the x dimension of the <a>WebVTT region anchor</a> and
     |regionAnchorX| be the x dimension of the <a>WebVTT region anchor</a>. Let |leftOffset| be
     |regionAnchorX| multiplied by |width| divided by 100.0. Let |left| be |leftOffset| subtracted
     from '|viewportAnchorX| vw'.</p></li>

     <li><p>Let |viewportAnchorY| be the y dimension of the <a>WebVTT region anchor</a> and
     |regionAnchorY| be the y dimension of the <a>WebVTT region anchor</a>. Let |topOffset| be
     |regionAnchorY| multiplied by |lines| divided by 100.0. Let |top| be |topOffset| subtracted
     from '|viewportAnchorY| vh'.</p></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Apply the terms of the CSS specifications to |regionNode| within the following constraints,
    thus obtaining a CSS box |box| positioned relative to an initial containing block:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>No style sheets are associated with |regionNode|. (The regionNodes are subsequently
     restyled using style sheets after their boxes are generated, as described below.)</p></li>
     <li><p>Properties on |regionNode| have their values set as defined in the next section. (That
     section uses some of the variables whose values were calculated earlier in this
     algorithm.)</p></li>
     <li><p>The viewport (and initial containing block) is video's rendering area.</p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Add the CSS box |box| to |output|.</p></li>
  </ol>
 </li>

 <li>
  <p>If |reset| is false, then, for each <a>WebVTT cue</a> |cue| in |cues|: if |cue|'s <a>text track
  cue display state</a> has a set of CSS boxes, then:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>If |cue|'s <a>WebVTT cue region</a> is not null, add those boxes to that region's |box|
   and remove |cue| from |cues|.</p></li>
   <li><p>Otherwise, add those boxes to |output| and remove |cue| from |cues|.</p></li>
  </ul>

 </li>

 <li>

  <p>For each <a>WebVTT cue</a> |cue| in |cues| that has not yet had corresponding CSS boxes added

  <ol>

   <li><p>Let |nodes| be the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> obtained by applying the <a>WebVTT
   cue text parsing rules</a>, with the fallback language |language| if provided, to the |cue|'s
   <a>text track cue text</a>.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>If |cue|'s <a>WebVTT cue region</a> is null, run the following substeps:</p>

    <ol>

     <li><a>Apply WebVTT cue settings</a> to obtain CSS boxes |boxes| from |nodes|.</li>

     <li><p>Let |cue|'s <a>text track cue display state</a> have the CSS boxes in |boxes|.</p></li>

     <li><p>Add the CSS boxes in |boxes| to |output|.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Otherwise, run the following substeps:</p>
    <ol>
     <li><p>Let |region| be |cue|'s <a>WebVTT cue region</a>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If |region|'s <a>WebVTT region scroll</a> setting is '<code>up</code>' and |region|
     already has one child, set |region|'s 'transition-property' to 'top' and 'transition-duration'

     <li><p>Let |offset| be |cue|'s <a lt="cue computed position">computed position</a> multiplied

    a hypothetical document that contains a single empty element with no explicit name, no
    namespace, no attributes, no classes, no IDs, and unknown primary language, that acts like the
    <a spec=html>media element</a> for the <a spec=html>text tracks</a> that were sourced from the
    given WebVTT file. The selectors must not match other <a spec=html>text tracks</a> for the same
    <a spec=html>media element</a>. In this hypothetical document, the element must not match any
    selector that would match the element itself.</p>

    <p class=note>This element exists only to be the <a spec=selectors>originating element</a> for
    the ''::cue'', ''::cue()'' and ''::cue-region'' pseudo-elements.</p>

   <li>
    <p>For the purpose of determining the <a spec=css-cascade>cascade</a> of the declarations in
    STYLE blocks of a WebVTT file, the relative order of appearance of the style sheets must be the
    same order as they were added to the collection, and the order of appearance of the collection
    must be after any style sheets that apply to the associated <a element spec=html>video</a>
    element's document.</p>

    <div class=example>
     <p>For example, given the following (invalid) HTML document:</p>

     <pre>

     ::cue { color:lime }

     00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
     Red or green?
     </pre>

     <p>The ''color:lime'' declaration would win, because it is last in the <a

<p>Every <a>WebVTT region object</a> is initialized with the following CSS settings:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the 'position' property must be set to ''position/absolute''</li>
 <li>the 'writing-mode' property must be set to ''writing-mode/horizontal-tb''</li>
 <li>the 'background' shorthand property must be set to 'rgba(0,0,0,0.8)'</li>
 <li>the 'overflow-wrap' property must be set to ''overflow-wrap/break-word''</li>
 <li>the 'font' shorthand property must be set to '5vh sans-serif'</li>
 <li>the 'color' property must be set to 'rgba(255,255,255,1)'</li>
 <li>the 'overflow' property must be set to ''overflow/hidden''</li>
 <li>the 'width' property must be set to |width|</li>
 <li>the 'min-height' property must be set to ''0px''</li>
 <li>the 'max-height' property must be set to |height|</li>
 <li>the 'left' property must be set to |left|</li>
 <li>the 'top' property must be set to |top|</li>
 <li>the 'display' property must be set to ''display/inline-flex''</li>
 <li>the 'flex-flow' property must be set to ''flex-flow/column''</li>
 <li>the 'justify-content' property must be set to ''justify-content/flex-end''</li>
</ul>

<p>The variables |width|, |height|, |top|, and |left| are the values with those names determined by
the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a> for the <a>WebVTT region</a> from
which the <a>WebVTT region object</a> was constructed.</p>

<p>The children of every <a>WebVTT region object</a> are further initialized with these CSS
settings:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the 'position' property must be set to ''position/relative''</li>
 <li>the 'unicode-bidi' property must be set to ''unicode-bidi/plaintext''</li>
 <li>the 'width' property must be set to ''width/auto''</li>
 <li>the 'height' property must be set to |height|</li>
 <li>the 'left' property must be set to |left|</li>
 <li>the 'text-align' property must be set as described for the root <a>List of WebVTT Node
 Objects</a> not part of a region</li>
</ul>

<p>All other non-inherited properties must be set to their initial values; inherited properties on
the root <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> must inherit their values from the <a>media element</a>
for which the <a>WebVTT cue</a> is being rendered, if any. If there is no <a>media element</a> (i.e.
if the <a>text track</a> is being rendered for another media playback mechanism), then inherited
properties on the root <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> and the <a lt="WebVTT region
object">WebVTT region objects</a> must take their initial values.</p>

<p>If there are style sheets that apply to the <a>media element</a> or other playback mechanism,
then they must be interpreted as defined in the next section.</p>


<h4 id=css-extensions>CSS extensions</h4>

<p>When a user agent is rendering one or more <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> according to the
<a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>, <a lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node
Objects</a> in the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a> used in the rendering can be matched by
certain pseudo-selectors as defined below. These selectors can begin or stop matching individual <a
lt="WebVTT Node Object">WebVTT Node Objects</a> while a <a lt="text track cue">cue</a> is being
rendered, even in between applications of the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text
tracks</a> (which are only run when the set of active cues changes). User agents that support the
pseudo-element described below must dynamically update renderings accordingly. When either
'white-space' or one of the properties corresponding to the 'font' shorthand (including
'line-height') changes value, then the <a>WebVTT cue</a>'s <a>text track cue display state</a> must
be emptied and the <a>text track</a>'s <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> must be
immediately rerun.</p>

<p>Pseudo-elements apply to elements that are matched by selectors. For the purpose of this section,
that element is the <i>matched element</i>. The pseudo-elements defined in the following sections
affect the styling of parts of <a lt="WebVTT cue">WebVTT cues</a> that are being rendered for the
<i>matched element</i>.</p>

<p class="note">If the <i>matched element</i> is not a <a element>video</a> element, the
pseudo-elements defined below won't have any effect according to this specification.</p>

<p>A CSS user agent that implements the <a lt="text track">text tracks</a> model must implement the
''::cue'' and ''::cue(|selector|)'' pseudo-elements, and the '':past'' and '':future''
pseudo-classes.</p>


<h5 id=the-cue-pseudo-element>The ''::cue'' pseudo-element</h5>

<p>The <dfn>::cue</dfn> pseudo-element (with no argument) matches any <a>list of WebVTT Node
Objects</a> constructed for the <i>matched element</i>, with the exception that the properties
corresponding to the 'background' shorthand must be applied to the <a>WebVTT cue background box</a>
rather than the <a>list of WebVTT Node Objects</a>.</p>

<p>The following properties apply to the ''::cue'' pseudo-element with no argument; other properties
set on the pseudo-element must be ignored:</p>

<ul class="brief">

<p>The <dfn>::cue(|selector|)</dfn> pseudo-element with an argument must have an argument that
consists of a CSS selector [[!SELECTORS4]]. It matches any <a>WebVTT Internal Node Object</a>
constructed for the <i>matched element</i> that also matches the given CSS selector, with the nodes
being treated as follows:</p>

<ul>

 <li><p>The <i>document tree</i> against which the selectors are matched is the tree of <a

<p class="note">If the matched element is not a video element, the pseudo-element defined below
